# Getting Started

### The Spotify Media Compiler is designed for Azuracast or Icecast supporting servers only, and can be ran in multiple ways. I would recommend knowledge on how you are going to implement it before continuing. For this example, let's keep it simple and run the application by itself.

---
## Installation Brief
```
Step 1) Download the SpotifyMediaCompiler.py file
Step 2) Place the file in a clear directory
Step 3) Edit variables with corresponding data
Step 4) Running the file
```
---
## Step 1) Downloading
### To download the file, head to the github page and click 'Download'
--
## Step 2) Relocating
### Make sure the file is out of any busy directories, moving it to an empty folder will help to improve the performance and prevent any errors
--
## Step 3) Editing Variables
### In order for the file to run, you must edit the corresponding data areas.
```
- Line 28 (Change to your spotify client id)
- Line 29 (Change to your spotify client secret)
- Line 111 (Change to your station IP with the endpoint '/api/nowplaying/{1, or applicable station number}
- Line 193 (Change to the prefix of your jingles to filter them out of the data)
```
--
## Step 4) Running
### The file can be ran on Windows using either [Visual Studio Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Python for Windows](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-310/9PJPW5LDXLZ5). 
### To run this file on Linux or Mac, please view alternative guides.
